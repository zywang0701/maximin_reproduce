##### Table 1 #####

In the folder "code/Irregular-Settings", run the script:
1. "I0to6.R" returns the RData files for (I0) (I1) ... (I6), by setting the argument "Setting"
2. "I7&8.R" returns the RData files for (I7) and (I8), by setting the argument "Setting"
3. "I9&10.R" returns the RData files for (I9) and (I10), by setting the argument "Setting"

The column "I(\delta)" is the average of "measure.sim";
The column "Coverage-Proposed" corresponds to the average of 8th column in "mat.store";
The column "Length-Proposed" corresponds to the average of 3rd column in "mat.store";
For the columns "Coverage-normality" and "Length-normality":
  (1) obtain the 1st column in "mat.store", corresponding to 500 simulated point estimators
  (2) compute the mean and standard error of these 500 simulated point estimators
  (3) build 95% confidence interval with normality based on above mean and se
  (4) for length: we compute the length of above confidence interval
  (5) for coverage: we count how many times the true value "trueList$true.val" is contained in the above confidence interval
The column "Length Ratio" is the division of "Length-Proposed" over "Length-normality";

##### Figure 3 #####

In the folder "code/Irregular-Settings", run the script:
1. "I0to6.R", set "Setting=1"
2. "I7&8.R", set "Setting=8"
3. "I9&10.R", set "Setting=10"
For the top-subfigures, pick the 500 simulated point estimators at the 1st column in "mat.store":
  (1) draw histograms with density of these point estimators
  (2) draw blue dashed vertical line with average
  (3) draw red vertical line with true value "trueList$true.val"
For the bot-subfigures, pick the 500 simulated weights at "weights.sim"
  (1) for the left bot-subfigure, draw histograms of "weights.sim[,4]"
  (2) for the middle and right bot-subfigures, draw histograms of "weights.sim[,1]"

##### Table 2 #####

In the folder "code/Main-Settings", run the corresponding script to each setting
In these script, set the arguments "n" across {200,300,500} and "delta.vec={0,0.1,0.5,1,2}"
Summarize the RDatas, the coverage and length are in 8th and 3rd column of "mat.store.List[[i.delta]]",
where i.delta = 1,2,3,4,5 indicating which delta it runs with.

##### Figure 4 #####

In the folder "code/Main-Settings", run script "Setting1"
In the script, set the arguments "n" across {100, 200, 300, 500} and "delta.vec={0,0.1, 0.5, 1, 2}"
Summarize the RDatas, coverage, CI length is the average of 8th and 3rd column of "mat.store.List[[i.delta]]",
where i.delta = 1,2,3,4,5 indicating which delta it runs with.
The length ratio is computed in the same approach explained in "Table 1"

##### Figure 5 #####

In the folder "code/Main-Settings", run script "Setting3a" and "Setting3b".
In each script, 
  (1)the argument "Setting=1": algorithm "CS Known"
  (2)the argument "Setting=2": algorithm "CS n=500"
  (3)the argument "Setting=3": algorithm "No CS N=500"
Then summarize the results in the same approach explained in "Figure 4"
